We combine spectroscopic data from APOGEE with\nastrometric data from Gaia DR3 to identify Gaia-Enceladus candidate stars via a\nmachine-learning pipeline using t-SNE and HDBSCAN. By focusing on kinematic and\nchemical parameters, especially $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, $\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$,\n$\\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$, and $\\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}$, we uncover a population of\nmetal-poor, high-eccentricity stars that align with literature criteria for\nGaia-Enceladus debris. We then apply the \\textit{OMEGA+} chemical evolution\nmodel, incorporating MCMC fitting of the observed abundance trends in the\n$\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]\\times[Fe/H]}$ plane. Our best-fitting model indicates a gas\nmass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\\times10^9\\,{M_{\\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus,\nplacing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model\nscenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a\nrapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a\nlesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data\nin other chemical planes (e.g., $\\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this\nscenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way.\nAdditionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in\nGaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier\ninferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of\nchemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient\naccreted systems.

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been\nintroduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based\non local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and\npoor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or\ndynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with\ndiverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless\nnetworks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability\nand adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate\nthe Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication\ntechnology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN,\nselecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only\ndefines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN.\nTo this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel\ngain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an\nimproved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the\nmodel experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and\nrobustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node\nselection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that\nthe DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs\ncomparably to the optimal approach.", "published": "2025-08-20T17:54:43+00:00", "updated": "2025-08-20T17:54:43+00:00", "primary_category": "eess.SP", "categories": ["eess.SP"], "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14884v1"}

Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between\nmodel size, batch size, and UTD.

This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator.

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection.

To improve robustness to such\nvariations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive\nTransformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses\nusing bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to\nimprove the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we\nintroduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic\nsimilarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,\naiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey\nrelevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss\nalone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT\nbaseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves\na 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error.
